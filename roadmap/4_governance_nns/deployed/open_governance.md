Service nervous systems (SNSs) are algorithmic DAOs that allow developers to create decentralized, token-based governance systems for their dapps. An SNS will initially consist of a ledger canister, the same as in the Network Nervous System (NNS), a governance canister, and a root canister.

This feature implements the SNS governance and the SNS root canister. The governance canister is similar to the NNSâ€™s governance canister but has a simpler and more flexible design, allowing each SNS community to choose the configurations according to their needs. This feature will also provide tooling for initializing an SNS. This is the first building block for the SNS, which will be further evolved in the Carbon milestone.
