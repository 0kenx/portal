This SNS rollout will include several initial features to enable self-governized DAOs: **1.** Special SNS subnet with increased security and maintainable upgrades, **2.** A first version of voting rewards for SNSs that can be further customised in the future, **3.** Decentralization sales that fund dapps as participants exchange ICP tokens for SNS tokens during an SNS launch. **4.** A minimal frontend dapp that allows end users to interact with the SNS in a user-friendly way. Various tooling will also be released to help users initialize an SNS.
