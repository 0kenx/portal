The community fund will to be made up of a set of neurons whose funds can be invested in dapps on the Internet Computer by enabling the “community fund” feature within a neuron. These ear-marked funds will be eligible for investment into communities that use an SNS, for example, by providing liquidity in the form of ICP for its tokens or funds for dapp developers. The exploration and definition of the exact form of such investments is part of this feature.
