The community fund is going to be made up of a set of neurons, whose funds are committed to being invested in IC dapps by enabling the “community fund” flag in those neurons. These ear-marked funds will be eligible for investment into communities that use an SNS, for example by providing liquidity in the form of ICP for its tokens or funds for dapp developers. The exploration and definition of the exact form of such investments is part of this feature.
