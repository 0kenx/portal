The Direct Integration with Ethereum and the Internet Computer plans to encompass a few implementations, as follows:

Ethereum blockchain integration: Integrating the Internet Computer blockchain with the Ethereum blockchain in a trustless manner, i.e., without using any trusted intermediaries such as bridges. This will enable smart contracts on the Internet Computer to call smart contracts on Ethereum and vice versa.

EVM support on the Internet Computer (IC): Providing an Ethereum execution environment (EVM) on the Internet Computer to run Solidity-/EVM-based smart contracts on the IC.
