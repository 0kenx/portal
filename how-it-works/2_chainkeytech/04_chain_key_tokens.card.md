# Chain-key tokens

Chain-key tokens — and Chain-Key Bitcoin (ckBTC) — are a cryptography-based replacement to wrapped tokens with strong decentralization advantages: Chain-key tokens eliminate the risks associated with the traditional intermediary-based token wrapping, while achieving the same advantages. *Chain-key cryptography* makes this possible: Taking the example of Bitcoin, a canister smart contract can own ECDSA key pairs and derive a Bitcoin addresses to which transfers of real Bitcoin can be made on the Bitcoin network. When receiving bitcoin, ckBTC is minted and issued in a 1:1 ratio to the sender of the bitcoin. Conversely, redeeming ckBTC for the underlying bitcoin removes the ckBTC from circulating supply and refunds the bitcoin.
