# Tokenomics

The Internet Computer (IC) is underpinned by advanced tokenomics. It makes use of an utility token called ICP. This token is used for a variety of functions on the platform, including participation in governance and paying for computation & storage. The IC also provides a framework for easy and transparent investment access to exciting Web3 projects, channeling ICP funds to productive usage of the platform.
