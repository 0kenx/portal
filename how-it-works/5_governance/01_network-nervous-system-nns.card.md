# Network Nervous System

The Internet Computer is a *decentralized* system run by many independent machines. These machines have to agree on certain facts, for example on what machines are part of the system, what program they should run, and when this program should be upgraded. On the Internet Computer these decisions are made by an open, tokenized governance system that is called the *Network Nervous System (NNS)*. The NNS is one of the largest decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). Anyone can become a participant of the NNS and contribute to decisions by staking ICP tokens.
