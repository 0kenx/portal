The Internet Computer is powered by a core protocol explained in this section. An instance of this core IC protocol stack is executed by the nodes of each subnet. To this end, each node of a subnet runs an implementation of the core protocol. The core IC protocol makes each subnet its own blockchain that runs its own instance of consensus and makes progress independently of the other subnets. The idea of many concurrently-operating subnets enables the IC to scale practically without limits.

In this section, we introduce the core IC protocol at a medium level of detail so that the reader can get a solid understanding of how the IC operates, but without diving into all the complexity or reading scientific papers.
