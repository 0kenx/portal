# Peer-to-peer

The peer-to-peer layer (P2P) of the Internet Computer, the bottommost layer in the protocol stack, realizes a virtual peer-to-peer broadcast network between the nodes of a subnet.
This makes the P2P layer the communications fabric that connects all the nodes of a subnet.
Using P2P, a node can broadcast a *message*, also called *artifact*, to all the nodes in the subnet.
Artifacts can be things like ingress messages or protocol messages (e.g., signature shares) generated by the IC protocol.
P2P ensures that artifacts to be broadcast are eventually delivered to all nodes of the subnet.
Eventual delivery reflects the asynchronous nature of practical communication networks, which we assume for the Internet Computer protocol.
