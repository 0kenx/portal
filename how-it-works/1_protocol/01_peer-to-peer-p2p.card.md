# Peer-to-peer layer

The peer-to-peer layer (P2P) of the Internet Computer, the lowest layer in the protocol stack, realizes a peer-to-peer broadcast network between the nodes of a subnet.
P2P is the communications fabric that connects the nodes of a subnet.
Using P2P, a node can broadcast a *message*, also called *artifact*, to all the nodes in the subnet.
Artifacts can be things like ingress messages or protocol messages generated by the IC protocol such as signature shares.
P2P ensures that artifacts to be broadcast are eventually delivered to all nodes of the subnet.
Eventual delivery reflects the asynchronous nature of practical communication networks.
