It extends the Internet with computation: dapps (smart contracts) can run 100% on the Internet Computer as it can serve web contents directly into browsers. Moreover, end-users can seamlessly and securely interact with dapps on the Internet Computer. In particular, users in general do not need any tokens to use a dapp nor is it necessary for anyone to download blockchain state to verify correctness of transactions because of the Internet Computer’s groundbreaking chain key cryptography. Users can securely authenticate to dapps using Internet Identity, the Internet Computer’s anonymous blockchain authentication framework.\n\nWe invite you to explore the Internet Computer’s cutting-edge technology developed by the industry’s largest R&D operation, a team of more than 200 world-renowned researchers and engineers.",
