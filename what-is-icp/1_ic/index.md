The Internet Computer (IC) is a general-purpose blockchain-based platform that can host and run web applications in a decentralized manner. It is designed to provide a World Computer that can replace traditional IT and enable a new generation of Web3 services and applications that run entirely on-chain. It can also play the role of Web3 orchestrator by interacting with other blockchains.

An open internet requires decentralization, which can be achieved with blockchains. However, there are efficiency, scalability, usability, and security issues with blockchain protocols. A radical new design is needed to realize the vision of a world computer. 

The IC builds a world computer from the ground up. By reworking the foundations, the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) has introduced many innovations in cryptography, networking, and consensus. The IC is more than just a blockchain.
