The IC platform is being actively developed and evolved and multiple exciting features unique to the IC are in the process of being released:
Service Nervous System (SNS): The SNS is an out-of-the-box deployable decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), similar to and based on the NNS, that can be used to tokenize and thereby decentralize the governance of any decentralized application on the IC.
Direct integration with Bitcoin: The IC will soon directly integrate with the Bitcoin network, i.e., without relying on any intermediaries, which is made possible by a protocol-level integration and by implementing a novel threshold ECDSA protocol as part of the IC.
Canister HTTPS outcalls: Canisters will be able to directly call Web 2.0 HTTPS services without involving any intermediaries (oracles), obviating the use of so-called bridges
