# How to interact with SNS governance
<!-- TODO 
Intro
* In general, there are two main ways to interact with an SNS: FE & sns-quill.
** quill is more secure because ...
** FE might exist also in the dapp (e.g., OC). To learn more about those, refer to the 
respective projects. Here we explain NNS FE dapp UI.
* Note that in the very first version fo the SNS, some interactions are only possible
on sns-quill
-->
For more information on how to participate in the SNS decentralization sale, we refer to
[this page](sale-interaction.md).

TEST [reference](./../../developer-docs/functionality/sns/deployment.md/#step3)



## Prerequisites
If you want to use quill, you also need to download sns-quill as explained
[here](https://github.com/dfinity/sns-quill#download).

## Getting SNS neurons 
<!-- TODO:
Before participating, you need a neuron.
Two ways to get one
1) participate in the [SNS decentralization sale](sale-interaction.md)
    and getting SNS neurons.
2) (once liquid tokens) have SNS tokens and stake them.
