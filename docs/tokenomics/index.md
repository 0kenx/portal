# Tokenomics and Governance

When building this developer documentation we tried to include the natural guides; how to [get started](../developer-docs/quickstart/) with canister smart contract development, how to [make progress](../developer-docs/build/), how to [deploy](../developer-docs/deploy/), update and manage apps. There were some remarks about cycles and their use in computation and about [integrating various features](../developer-docs/integrations/) of the IC. Yet, somehow it still felt like something was lacking in the documentation. Building on the IC is about more than just the code. 

Building decentralized applications inherently requires us to open our minds to new ways of thinking and coding, but also of interacting, controlling, funding and planning. This category of documentation aims to capture the more *entrepreneurial* considerations that will likely arise in a move towards a more open internet. This is done both via noting considerations that should be made by developers and builders, but also by end users of apps, as, after all, the line between these types of people becomes ever more blurry.

## Governance

### Network Nervous System (NNS)

As we move to more and more decentralization, it is crucial to learn more about the IC components that facilitate community governance.

### Service Nervous System (SNS)

## Identity & Authentication

One of the advantages of building apps on the Internet Computer is that users can interact and authenticate without the need for holding tokens. This is facilitated by Internet Identity.

## Token Holders
There are multiple ways to obtain token; purchasing via an exchange, earning as a node provider, receiving from a friend, or otherwise. Learn about some options for how to hold tokens, and how you can set up self-custody. Follow the quickstart to take control of your tokens.
