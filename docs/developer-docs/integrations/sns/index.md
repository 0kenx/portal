# Service Nervous System (SNS)

We anticipate that different target groups are interested
in different aspects of the Service Nervous System (SNS)
and thus in different kinds of documentations.
We thus try to split the SNS documentation accordingly.

This page provides an overview of the SNS documentation and 
provides links to the parts that already exist.
Some of the SNS documentation is still being worked on and will be 
edited or added as the last SNS features are added, so please bare with
us if it is not yet complete or a few parts do not yet work.


## Technical documentation
This documentation is, as the name suggests, aimed at
developers.
Most of the documentation targets developers that have
a dapp that they would like to decentralize with an SNS. 
However, this documentation also targets developers that
want to build services that integrate with SNSs, such as wallet dapps
or decentralized exchanges.  

In this documentation you will find
* [A technical introduction to the SNS](sns-intro.md)

* Information on how to **get an SNS**, which includes
    * [An introduction how to get an SNS](get-sns/get-sns-intro.md) which
      exlains the high level stages of gettin an SNS
    * [Technical preparations for getting an SNS](get-sns/preparation.md) which
      describes the technical steps required before getting an SNS. here
      We also link to non-technical steps that we recommend,
      which can be found under the "DAO and Tokenomics" documentation
      targeted at a less technical audience.
