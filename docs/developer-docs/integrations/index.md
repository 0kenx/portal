# Functionality Integrations

While previous sections guide you to start building canisters on the IC, here you can see how to integrate various (sometimes advanced) extra functionality to your dapp.

## Bitcoin Integration
* [Bitcoin Integration](./bitcoin/index.md) gives a longer overview
* [How it works](./bitcoin/bitcoin-how-it-works.md) dives further into the details
* [local development](./bitcoin/local-development.md) contains a tutorial showing how to experiment locally

## Threshold ECDSA
* [Threshold ECDSA](./t-ecdsa/index.md) gives an overview of what can be achieved with this feature
* See [How it works](./t-ecdsa/t-ecdsa-how-it-works.md) to dive further into the details

## HTTPS Outcalls
* [HTTPS outcalls](./http_requests/index.md) gives an overview of how the IC can communicate with the world outside
* [How it works](./http_requests/http_requests-how-it-works.md) to dive further into the details and gives a comparison against oracles

## Internet Identity
* [Internet Identity](./internet-identity/integrate-identity.md) gives an overview of how to use internet identity in your app

## ICP Ledger
* [Ledger overview](./ledger/index.md) to get a view of the ICP ledger basics
* [Interact](./ledger/interact-with-ledger.md) shows the commands and protocol flows to interact with the ICP ledger

* [Deploy New Token](./ledger/deploy-new-token.md) describes how to deploy a new token and connect to Rosetta

## Rosetta
* The [Rosetta page](./rosetta/index.md) describes how to set up a Rosetta node and answers some FAQs
* [transfers](./rosetta/transfers.md) details how to transfer ICP using the Rosetta Construction API
* [neuron lifecycle](./rosetta/neuron-lifecycle.md) gives an overview of neurons (IC assets allowing controllers to participate in the governance of the network by submitting and voting on proposals)
* [staking support](./rosetta/staking-support.md) specifies extensions of the Rosetta API enabling staking funds and managing governance neurons on the IC
* [staking tutorial](./rosetta/staking-tutorial.md) walks through the process of creating a neuron
* [hotkeys](./rosetta/hotkeys.md) explains how to generate a hotkey for neuron management
