# How to deploy an SNS

We explain how to deploy an SNS that is provided as a 
system functionality by the IC.
As explained in the [introduction](sns.md), there are also other 
ways to deploy and maintain a DAO. Many concepts explained here may be 
relevant for you even if you deploy another kind of DAO.

We introduce here an overview of different steps that you might want to 
consider when launching an SNS and link to pages that provide
more details for each of them. 

### Non-technical preparation for the SNS launch
The successful launch of an SNS does not only depend on technical
aspects. 
In fact, it is advisable that before taking any technical steps, 
you take some non-technical preparations steps. 
To motivate this better, let's look at two examples of such non-technical
considerations in the following.

**Example 1.** 
To decentralize a dapp, the governance control has to be distributed 
among many parties. Therefore, a successful decentralization relies on
reaching many parties and convincing them to participate in the 
governance system. Achieving this may rely on non-technical strategies,
such as proper advertising and marketing.

**Example 2.**
The SNS implementation is very flexible and allows each SNS
community to set various parameters according to their needs.
Choosing these parameters entails non-technical work to define
which goals a given SNS should pursue.
For example, you can configure parameters that determine how much
voting rewards are distributed to users that participate in SNS 
governance and how often these rewards are distributed.
Choosing these parameters entails non-technical considerations,
such as deciding on a tokenomics plan that defines in what ways
the SNS tokens will be used and what behaviors should be incentiviced.

These examples show that before diving into the technical details, you 
may want to spend some time defining non-technical goals of the SNS you
are about to launch and the dapp that will be controlled by it.
To provide some tips on what considerations you should not forget,
we list a few of them on [this page](TODO).

### Technical pre-deployment activities
Once you have defined

Once all that planned, need to understand how this translates to 
the actual launch.

Then, probably donâ€™t want to immediately go live without testing.
So once parameters set, want to test. [link to local-testing.md]

Once properly tested, ready to launch, which is described in more
