# Getting Started

To keep the instructions simple and focused on the task at hand, the
*Quick start* is deliberately hyper-focused in helping you deploy your
first smart contract or dapp in 20 minutes or less.

See [How to deploy hello world smart contract in 20
minutes](how-to-deploy-hello-world-smart-contract.xml).

# More Sample Code

Once you finish your first dap, you can see more robust examples (e.g.
DAOs, NFTs, etcâ€¦) in [Sample code and dapps](../examples/index.xml).
