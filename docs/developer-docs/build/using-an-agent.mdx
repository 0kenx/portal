# Using an Agent

If you have a canister running, either on your local machine or live on the Internet Computer, you will have two main ways to interact with your canister smart contract. You can talk to the canister using the v2 API using an `agent` that follows the interface specification, or you can use the canister's http interface.

## Calling a Canister

In the Internet Computer ecosystem, a library that is used to make calls to the IC public interface is called an agent. An agent has a few key responsibilities, which make it convenient to work with in your language of choice. 

A list of agents is available at [other languages -> agents](./languages/other-languages/other-languages-intro#interfacing-with-canisters-agents).

### 1. Structuring Data

A `call` to the Internet Computer can take two common forms - an `update` or a `query`. The `agent` submits a POST request to `/api/v2/canister/<effective_canister_id>/call`, and includes the following components: 
* `request_type`
* Authentication
    * `sender`, `nonce`, and `ingress_expiry`
* `canister_id`
* `method_name`
* `arg` - the rest of the payload

By knowing the Candid interface of the canister, the `agent` will assemble the `"arg"` by `cbor`-encoding the data from the client application, and ensuring it matches the Candid interface for the method it will be calling. That encoded data will be turned into a buffer.

The `agent` takes all of that information, bundles it up into a certificate, and attaches it to the body of the POST request. The canister will work on that request asynchronously, and then the `agent` can begin polling with `read_state` requests, until the canister response is ready.

### 2. Decoding Data

Once the data has been returned from the IC, the `agent` takes the certificate from the payload and verifies it. The certificate can be verified as genuine using the public `rootKey` of the NNS subnet. The network will respond with a `cbor`-encoded buffer, which the `agent` can then decode, and transform into a useful structure using semantic language-specific types. For example, if the type returned from the canister is `text`, that will get turned into a JavaScript `string`, and so on.

### 3. Managing Authentication

Calls to the Internet Computer always need to have a cryptographic identity attached. That identity will either be Anonymous or Authenticated, using a cryptographic signature. Since identities are required, canisters can use the identity attached to a call to decide how to respond to that call. This enables contracts to use those identities for other purposes. 

#### Accepted Identities

The IC accepts calls using the following types of identities:

* Ed25519
* Secp256k1
* ECDSA with a P-256 curve

When encoding these identities as a Principal, agents attach a suffix byte, indicating whether the identity is self-authenticating or anonymous. 

A self-authenticating identity using one of the above curves will have a suffix of 2.

While the anonymous identity is a single byte 4. It resolves to `"2vxsx-fae"`, in its textual encoding.


## Canister HTTP Interface

In addition to the Candid interface, if a canister has a `http_request` method, the boundary nodes will forward HTTP and HTTPS calls to the `http_request` method. Using this, approach, the canister can deliver assets or custom data via the http interface.

If you are delivering certified responses, the http endpoint can be accessed by a serviceworker at `https://<canister-id>.ic0.app`. If you are not delivering certified responses, you can use the `raw` subdomain at `https://<canister-id>.raw.ic0.app`. 

> Note: the raw subdomain uses queries to a single replica. Accessing critical data over `raw.ic0.app` should not be considered safe
