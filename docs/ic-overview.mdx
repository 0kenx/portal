# Getting started

You find yourself in the home of documentation and developer resources for the Internet Computer (IC).
The IC hosts special smart contracts, called [canisters](https://medium.com/dfinity/software-canisters-an-evolution-of-smart-contracts-internet-computer-f1f92f1bfffb) which are bundles of [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) bytecode logic and memory pages.
Dapps on the IC are created from one or more canisters.

To download the Internet Computer SDK, run the following command in a Linux or macOS terminal:

``` bash
  sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://internetcomputer.org/install.sh)"
```

[Installing the SDK](/developer-docs/build/install-upgrade-remove.mdx) provides more detailed installation instructions, including how to run the SDK on Windows using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).
