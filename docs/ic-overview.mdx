# Internet Computer Documentation

As the IC ecosystem grows so do our resources. This is the home of documentation, sample
code, tooling, and support.

## Tutorials

Tutorials help you to get started with minimal knowledge and progress towards better understanding of
Internet Computer development.

Featured tutorials:
- **Deploying the first app.** Deploy your first app on Internet Computer MainNet in three simple steps. It's that easy!
- **Creating your own app.**  Create a sample app that implements an Internet poll using Motor programming language and Vue.js


## Guides

Guides explain each aspect of Internet Computer development in detail. Learn how to setup your development environment, code your backend using Motoko or Rust, create a backend using popular development frameworks, deploy your app in production and scale it to support millions of users. 

Featured guides:
- **Setting up development environment.** Install SDK, configure your secure identity, acquire ICP and cycles, run your app locally and deploy in production.
- **Create canister backend.** Create your app backend in Motoko or Rust by coding app data structures, query and update methods and connect to core IC features.
